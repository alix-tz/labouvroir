The CIÉCO’s partnership explores the museographic possibilities offered by web publishing to document collection displays, the biography of certain objects (axis 1) and the documentation of performative works that exploit their archives (axis 3). As for the Digital Encyclopedia, it will make extensive use of a rich illustration that we hope to deploy interactively. In the absence of a free and open source generic library intended for the presentation of heritage content, the creation of online exhibitions is most often the subject of specific and punctual developments. Based on the survey and typology of practices on new uses of collections carried out by the digital unit of the project (axis 4), we propose to develop a tool designed to easily deploy digital writings based on museum and visual documentation. This tool will be used for the experiments of specific content publications planned in axis 1, axis 2 and 3 as well as for the illustration of the Multimedia Encyclopedia.

This application takes the form of a free and open source code library developed in ECMAScript6 (“vanilla” JavaScript) in order to facilitate its maintenance and durability. This software core is intended to facilitate the production of digital exhibitions and the exploitation of collections on the web by defining responsive design templates for the creation of resources or galleries, with a diversity of user interactions specific to the scholarly presentation of visual documentation on the web (image comparison, browsing, zooming, structured captions and access to metadata). Its functional scope integrates compatibility with the various protocols of the International Image Interoperability Framework [IIIF](https://iiif.io). Whenever possible, developments are based on the integration of available free and open source JavaScript components ([OpenSeedragon](https://openseadragon.github.io), Mirador, etc.).

**Reframe is designed by the laboratory in the framework of the Partnership [New uses of collections in art museums](http://www.cieco.co/). Project manager: Lena Krause. Scientific director: Emmanuel Chateau-Dutier.*
