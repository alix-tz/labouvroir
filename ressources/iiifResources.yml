    description: "Carnegie Museum of Art is arguably the first museum of contemporary art in the United States, collecting the “Old Masters of tomorrow” since the inception of the Carnegie International in 1896. Today, CMOA is one of the most dynamic major art institutions in America. Our collection of more than 30,000 objects features a broad spectrum of visual arts, including painting and sculpture; prints and drawings; photographs; architectural casts, renderings, and models; decorative arts and design; and film, video, and digital imagery. The museum also houses an important archive of its film and video program; dating to 1970, it was one of the first programs of its kind in an American museum. Since 2001, CMOA has been the home for the Teenie Harris Archive, a collection of nearly 80,000 images made between ca. 1935 and ca. 1975 that serves as one of the most detailed and intimate records of the black urban experience known today. Through our programming, exhibitions, and publications, we frequently explore the role of art and artists in confronting key social issues of our time, combining and juxtaposing local and global perspectives."

    title: Satens Museum fur Kunts SMK 
    description: "SMK owns the nation’s largest art collection, comprising approximately 260,000 works of art. The collection was originally founded as the royal collection, meaning that it was the private property of the Danish kings, but with the introduction of democracy in Denmark in the mid-1800s, the kings’ art collection was given to the people. That gift eventually became SMK. Works of art from the large collection can be viewed at exhibitions and presentations at SMK. But because the collection is so vast, only a small part of it will be on display when you visit SMK on any given day. Many works from the collection will be accessible at other museums in Denmark or abroad, being displayed as part of their exhibitions, but the bulk of the collection will be stowed away in the museum’s storage facilities. SMK is currently working towards realising its ambition to have its entire art collection digitised, making it freely available online."

    title: Museum-digital
    description: "museum-digital is an initiative, it is a software suite, and it is a platform. In January 2009, museum workers from the German state of Saxony-Anhalt gathered at the Kreismuseum Bitterfeld to discuss digitization and agreed to go online together. This was the founding event of museum-digital. Even then it was clear: Going online and becoming visible can only be achieved together. Together, software was developed; together, the museums present themselves and their objects online. What started as a small group in Saxony-Anhalt has now grown into a community that transcends national and language borders."

    use: "IIIF API, Mirador Viewer. At museum-digital, museums can upload their images – but since some museums have their own image servers, museums can also link images from external sources. In this latter case, museum-digital only stores previews up to a width of 500 pixels. These previews are however not usable for an adequate server-side image editing as required for implementing IIIF. Thus we offer IIIF manifests only for objects that exclusively have locally stored images. We currently also implement IIIF only in version 2.1, which does not yet support other media types such as PDFs, videos, audio files or 3D representations of objects. Hence, objects that have any linked representations of these types are also excluded from the IIIF API.

    description: "The Philadelphia Museum of Art is pleased to announce that the Duchamp Research Portal (https://www.duchamparchives.org) is now live! It provides free access to more than 18,000 documents and artworks, comprising nearly 50,000 digitized images related to the work and life of Marcel Duchamp. 
    
    The cross-cultural and multilingual portal is the outcome of a seven-year partnership between the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the Association Marcel Duchamp, and the Centre Pompidou. Among the wealth of resources available in the portal are the vast Alexina and Marcel Duchamp Papers and Arensberg Archives at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the archival collections of the Association Marcel Duchamp, the André Breton and Constantin Brancusi collections at the Centre Pompidou, and holdings relating to major Duchamp retrospective exhibitions held in Philadelphia in 1973 and at the Centre Pompidou in 1977. The archive also contains materials linked to the development and installation of the artist’s final major work, Étant donnés 1° la chute d’eau, 2° le gaz d’éclairage (Given: 1. The Waterfall, 2. The Illuminating Gas) (1946–66)."
