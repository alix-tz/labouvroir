Assistant Professor at Département d'histoire de l'art et d'études cinématographiques, Université de Montréal.

My areas of expertise are sculpture, architecture, and history from 1000 to 1300. My research focuses on two principal areas: the dynamic  relationship among sculpture, epigraphy, architecture, and ritual  activity in the Middle Ages, and the material processes in medieval art  and architecture, specifically through 3D reconstructions of medieval  monuments. I employ new media and information technology coupled with  traditional research methods to perform qualitative and quantitative  analysis. This approach allows me to reevaluate long-held assumptions  about canonical sites, such as the cloister sculpture at Moissac and  architectural sculpture in the abbey church at Vézelay as well as gain  insights into medieval architectural design and construction methods.
