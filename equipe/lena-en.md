Lena Krause works as lab manager of _Ouvroir_. She holds a BA in art history and computer sciences for the humanities from Geneva University and a MA in art history from Université de Montréal. Interested in experimenting with digital tools and methods in art history, she specialises in cartigraphy and interactive visualisation of cultural data, such as in her Master's thesis ["Creating a digital atlas of public architecture (1795-1840). Editorialisation of a database in art history"](https://public.archi/atlas-2021) under the supervision of Emmanuel Château-Dutier. In fall 2023, she begins a PhD in art history, specialized in research-creation, in data visualization of cultural contents.
