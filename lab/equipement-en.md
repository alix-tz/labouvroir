Ouvroir, the digital art history and museology lab provides a collaborative workspace and computer facilities for multimedia production and three-dimensional visualization, as well as cloud computing services.

We are located on the 8ᵗʰ floor of Lionel-Groulx Pavilion (Université de Montréal, 3150 rue Jean-Brillant, Montréal H3T 1N8). The lab space is shared with the Centre de recherche interuniversitaire sur les humanités numériques ([CRIHN](https://www.crihn.org)). The lab space comprises: 
- a collaborative workroom and conference room (C-8132, 12 seats)
- multiple workstations for individual research or small groups (C-8132 and C-8134, 6 seats)
- two 3D and multimedia creation stations (2 places)
- an office for the lab manager and the CIÉCO and CRIHN coordinators (C-8130)

### Booking a workstation

The lab is currently moving into its new premises. You can now book a workstation [online](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11EBiGa9AELoJt5j9KANnbXz3EGMhc8vrqQBaHLwTkfo/edit?usp=sharing). Please be aware that C-8132 gives access to the conference room, where there are several events and meetings on Tuesdays, including the Fika coffee break from 3 to 4pm.

The workstations are divided into 4 desks:

- `Marcelle Ferron`desk (1-2 seats, C-8132) faces a glass wall between the front room and the conference room. It accommodates one person, or a two-person team.
- `Yayoi Kusama` desk (1-3 seats, C-8132) is next to the purple wall. It has one to two workstations, and can accommodate up to three people working as a group. You willl find it equipped with a screen and an HDMI cable. 
- `Nadia Myre` desk (1 person, C-8134) faces left when entering  C-8134. It has an adjustable tabletop that can function as a standing desk.
- `Gina Pane` desk (1 person, C-8134) is located in front of the yellow brick wall. An iMac can be used on demand (keyboard and trackpad are stored for safety).
