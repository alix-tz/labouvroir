title: 'Code de conduite'
description: "Code of conduct for using the lab"
---

Participating in digital projects in art history and museum studies often implies heavily collective work. For each person to fully benefit from the lab’s servces, we care about it being an inclusive space that does not tolerate any discrimination. Equipement usage and participation in the lab’s activities is conditionnal to the acceptance and to the consideration of the code of conduct.

Ouvroir has chosen the  [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/fr/version/2/0/code_of_conduct/) as code of conduct. We invite all participants to read it carefully and to conform to it.
