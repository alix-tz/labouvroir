title: 'Code of conduct'
description: "Code of conduct for using the lab"
---

Digital projects in art history and museum studies often imply collaborative work. For each person to fully benefit from the lab’s services, we aim to maintain an inclusive space where discrimination is not tolerated. Equipment usage and participation in the lab’s activities is conditional upon the acceptance and consideration of the code of conduct.

Ouvroir has chosen the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/fr/version/2/0/code_of_conduct/) as our code of conduct. We invite all participants to read it carefully and to conform to it.
